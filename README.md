# Pok√©mon
Data analysis project which Is analyzing data about characters in the Pokemon series of games. I carried out this project using Python 3.8 and Jupyter Notebook; packages used include Pandas and Matplotlib. I've included my Jupyter Notebook as 'pokemon_MAC.ipynb.' 

The data set I used for this project was downloaded from Kaggle.com, and more speciifically from the URL https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/pokemon. 

In this project, I investigated my own Pokemon pokedex, or at least the English names of the various Pokemon, their associated pokedex number, and whether or not I have found one. I have included this file as "MAC_pokemon.csv."
